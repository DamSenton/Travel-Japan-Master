# Travel Japan

**This is my first milestone project for The Coding Institute**

The project is an in-depth travel guide for Japan, and also provides a gallery of some personal photgraphs to highlight some of my favourite places in Japan.

## UX

This website is for those interested in travelling to Japan

Users will find themsleves ables to naviagte around this page easily with a responsive and user-friendly navigation bar.

A newsletter modal will also show for users on larger screens to give them an option to sign up to hear about any news regarding this travel website.

While designing the website, I used Figma to wireframe my ideas.

## Features

The landing page has Bootstrap elements in place in order to display content responsively on all devcie widths.

The navigation bar is set up in a way which is standard across most websites to give users an intuitive desgin that they are already familiar with.

The gallery page employs some aimations which, when hovered over, provide the user with small descriptions about each image.

### *Features left to implement*
 
* The main content on the landing page needs fleshing out to draw users in and give them a better understanding of Japan.
* I would also like to embed a map on various sections of my website, however, I do not see myself having the time to do this.

## Technologies used

For this website i have utilised HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, Google Fonts, and a small amount of JavaScript.

[HTML5] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
* This language is used to build the overall body of the page, from text, to page structures.

[CSS3] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3)
* CSS3 is used to style the elements on the page. CSS3 is responsible for the colour scheme, and the layout of the page.

[Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com/)
* Bootstrap is a powerful tool which gives developers multiple snippets of code to use in their projects, which can then be styled through CSS3.

[Font Awesome] (https://fontawesome.com/)
* Font Awesome is a tool used to provide icons which add to the overall aesthetic of the web page.

[Google Fonts] (https://fonts.google.com/)
* Google fonts provides the user with different options for fonts to be used in web pages, further adding to the personalization of each page.

[JavaScript] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
* While i am not well versed in JavaScript yet, I know that is is repsonsible for making a webpage more interactive for the user.

### Content

The animatins used on the landing page was created by Avi Tour on [https://freefrontend.com/css-hover-effects/] And edited by myself to fit the colour scheme of the website.

The animation for the images on the 'Galler' page was also inspired by the above, but edited by me to fit the purpose of the gallery.




### Media

* The hero image, the main content backgrounds and the 'Book Now' form background were taken from Google using the 'Advanced Image Search' to ensure no copyright infringments occured.

* All of the images on the 'Gallery' page were taken by myself while on a personal trip to Japan and uploaded to [https://Imgur.com] to enable me to embed them on this page.

### Acknowledgments

* This project was inspired by a lot of travel websites and also the mini projects completed alongside The Code Institute.
