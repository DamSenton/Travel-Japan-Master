# Travel Japan

**This is my first milestone project for The Coding Institute**

The project is an in-depth travel guide for Japan, and also provides a gallery of some personal photgraphs to highlight some of my favourite places in Japan.

## UXD

This website is for those interested in travelling to Japan

Users will find themsleves ables to naviagte around this page easily with a responsive and user-friendly navigation bar.

A newsletter modal will also show for users on larger screens to give them an option to sign up to hear about any news regarding this travel website.

While designing the website, I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/files/project/9354776/First-Project)
to wireframe my ideas.

## User Design Purpose:

### Strategy Plane:

* This website is aimed at those who have a base level interest in Japan, and would like to explore the idea
of travelling to this area.

* With a basic, intuitive design, all users should be able to find their way around this website with ease.

### Scope Plane:

* The overall intention of this website is to draw users in with aesthetically pleasing, and informative information,
so that they will want to hear more, and eventually book a trip with this company.

* This website consists of 3 pages. A landing page, a gallery and a booking page. Each laid out to keep a common theme for
the website, and each page is responsive on
various screen sizes.

### Structure Plane:

* The layout of this web page is built with user appeal in mind. The layout is simplistic, yet stylish enough to catch the eyes of all users.

* The information on the page is set out in such a way as to not be over-bearing, but also not uninformative.

### Skeleton Plane:

* The naviagtion of this website is incredibly intuitive, and responsive. The layout is familiar to most users,
and this provides the user with a sense of security, knowing they can easily navigate the webpage and interact with it's functionality.

### Surface Plane:

* This web page provides the user with a visually pleasing, and intuitive experience that will make them want to visit again to keep
up with any new information posted on the website.

* The font and colours are all matched correctly to keep a familiar feel to each seperate page.

## Features

* The landing page has Bootstrap elements in place in order to display content responsively on all devcie widths.

* The navigation bar is set up in a way which is standard across most websites to give users an intuitive desgin that they are already familiar with.

* The gallery page employs some animations which, when hovered over, provide the user with small descriptions about each image.

* The booking page is laid out in a way that is visually appealing on all screen sizes.
the form on this page allows users to build the type of holiday they want, and then they can receive an email which provides them with various options.

### _Features left to implement_

* I wish to embed a map onto the main content sections which would give users a better understanding of the geograpgical location of each article,
  however, with my limited skill set and time restraints, I am unable to implement this at this time.

* With a lack of JavaScript knowledge, it is hard to implement an automated email response for users who have filled in the booking form.
but I would like to implement this, but will unfortunately not be able to without the necessary knowledge.

## Technologies used

* For this website I have utilised HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Font Awesome, Google Fonts, and a small amount of JavaScript.

[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)

- This language is used to build the overall body of the page, from text, to page structures.

[CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets#CSS_3)

- CSS3 is used to style the elements on the page. CSS3 is responsible for the colour scheme, and the layout of the page.

[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

- Bootstrap is a powerful tool which gives developers multiple snippets of code to use in their projects, which can then be styled through CSS3.

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)

- Font Awesome is a tool used to provide icons which add to the overall aesthetic of the web page.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

- Google fonts provides the user with different options for fonts to be used in web pages, further adding to the personalization of each page.

[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)

- While I am not well versed in JavaScript yet, I know that is is repsonsible for making a webpage more interactive for the user.

## Testing

- Testing for this website was carried out by myself, navigating the webpage from each link, and making sure everything lead to the right place.

- Testing for responsiveness was made easy with the Chrome Developer Tool which enabled me to alter the screen size for my web page to check
  everything was responsive so that every user, regardless of which device they are using, can have the experience I intend for them to have.

## Credits

- This project was inspired by a lot of travel websites and also the mini projects completed alongside The Code Institute.

- All of the code for this project was written by myself, with the exception of the animations for the Gallery Images, in which I took inspiration from CoreLangs.com. This code is free to use for learning purposes.

* The image used for the 'Attraction of the Month' section was taken from [Takuma Mori](https://www.flickr.com/photos/takuma104/) on Flickr. I am free to use and distribute this with the proper credit.

### Content

- All of the articles on this page were concieved entirely by myself.

- The web page layout takes inspirtaion from multiple Code Institute projects. I have taken elements from almost each project and repurposed them to fit my web page.

### Media

- The hero image, the main content backgrounds and the 'Book Now' form background were taken from Google using the 'Advanced Image Search' to ensure no copyright infringments occured.

- All of the images on the 'Gallery' page were taken by myself while on a personal trip to Japan and uploaded to [https://Imgur.com] to enable me to embed them on this page.
